# Operators

An operator in JavaScript is a standalone piece of syntax that forms an expression and is
typically used to derive something or compute a logical or mathematical output from a set
of inputs

Any operator can be said to have four characteristics:

- **Its arity:** how many operands the operator accepts
- **Its function:** what the operator does with its operands and what it evaluates to
- **Its precedence:** how the operator will be grouped when used in combination
  with other operators
- **Its associativity:** how the operator will behave when neighbored with operators
  of the same precedence

Types of JavaScript operators:

- [Arithmetic and numeric operators](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/clean_code/tree/main/principles/Operators/ArithmeticOperators)
- [Logical operators]()
- [Comparative operators]()
- [Assignment operators]()
- [Property access operators]()
- [Other operators and syntax]()
