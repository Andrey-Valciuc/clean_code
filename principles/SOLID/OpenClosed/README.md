# O - Open Closed Principle (OCP)

**Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:**

- _Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification._

So what this principle wants to say is: We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing code for the class. This is because whenever we modify the existing code, we are taking the risk of creating potential bugs.
