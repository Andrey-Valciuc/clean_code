# O - Open Closed Principle (OCP)
**Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:**

Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself. When crafting abstractions, we should enable them to be open to extension so that other developers can come along and build upon their behavior, adapting the abstraction to suit their needs. Extension, in this context, is best thought of as a broad term that encompasses all types of adaptation. If a module or function does not behave as we require it to, it would be ideal for us to be able to adapt it to our needs without having to modify it or create our own alternative.
