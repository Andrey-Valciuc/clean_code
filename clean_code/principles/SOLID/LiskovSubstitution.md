# L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Liskov Substitution Principle states:**

- _Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T._ \*

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
